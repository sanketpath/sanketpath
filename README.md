### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sanket (he/him).

I'm a DesignOps lead at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). When I'm not working, I like to spend time meeting new people or learning to code or tinkering with new apps and tools.


#### Writing
I write on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sanketpath) about design, work and life in-general. I'm have recently started my [blog](https://blog.sanketpathak.com) soon. Being a designer and a hobbyist coder, you can expect it to be forever in design <> development. 



#### My Learning Framework
One Year Framework

Whatever you decide to learn today, decide to be good at it in exactly a year. Not tomorrow, not a day after, not in a month but a year. It's an ample amount of time and it helps your mind to be less anxious about the failures that may occur and helps you enjoy the process.
