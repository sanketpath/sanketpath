### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sanket (he/him).

I'm a product designer and a hobbyist coder. Currently, I'm working on [Integrations](https://www.postman.com/integrations/) in Postman.
(Psst.. if you've used Integrations on Postman and have any critic or appreciation, hit me up.)


#### Writing
I write on Twitter about design and work-life in general. I'm planning to write on my blog soon; more on that below.

#### My Learning Framework
One Year Framework

Whatever you decide to learn today, decide to be good at it in exactly a year. Not tomorrow, not a day after, not in a month but a year. It's an ample amount of time and it helps your mind to be less anxious about the failures that may occur and helps you enjoy the process.
