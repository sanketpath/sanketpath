### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sanket (he/him).

I'm a product designer and a hobbyist coder. Currently, I'm leading DesignOps at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).


#### Writing
I write on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sanketpath) about design, work and life in-general. I'm planning to start my [blog](https://blog.sanketpathak.com) soon. It's currently in design<>development.



#### My Learning Framework
One Year Framework

Whatever you decide to learn today, decide to be good at it in exactly a year. Not tomorrow, not a day after, not in a month but a year. It's an ample amount of time and it helps your mind to be less anxious about the failures that may occur and helps you enjoy the process.
